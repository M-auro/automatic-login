# automatic-login
Automating a login process using the requests library:

Replace 'https://example.com/login' with the actual login URL of the website you want to automate the login for. Also, replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual login credentials.

This code uses the requests library to create a session, perform a POST request with the login credentials, and stores the session information for subsequent authenticated requests.

Note that the specific details of the login process may vary depending on the website or application you are working with. You may need to inspect the login form or API endpoints of the website to determine the correct data to include in the login_data dictionary.
